    "**Description:**    \n",
    "This notebook provides Python code to create a MySQL database from CSV files with data about professional tennis matches.  The data comes from two sources:  basic player and outcome information is from https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp, while odds data are from  http://www.tennis-data.co.uk/alldata.  The code in this notebook should be run before running the learning algorithms in the notebook [tennis_predictions](../tennis_predictions.ipynb), which assumes that the MySQL database has already been created. \n",

    "Path and file names can be configured in the first cell below.  As it stands, this notebook assumes that file names and directory structures are as reflected in this github site.   \n",

    "The CSV files within Sackmann dataset are as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "    *  \"atp_matches_xxxx.csv\" (xxxx represents a year between 1968 and 2017)\n",
    "    *  \"atp_matches_futures_xxxx.csv\" (xxxx is a year between 1991 and 2017)\n",
    "    *  \"atp_matches_qual_chall_xxxx.csv\" (xxxx is a year between 1991 and 2017)\n",
    "There is also a single CSV file with player info:\n",
    "    * \"atp_players.csv\"\n",
    "and week-by-week rankings by decade, stored in files with names as follows:\n",
    "    *  \"atp_rankings_xxs.csv\" (xx represents a decade--70,80,90,00, or 10)\n",
    "The rankings of the current decade are stored in\n",
    "    *  \"atp_rankings_current.csv\"\n",
    "The CSV files within the directory \"odds_data\" are of the form\n",
    "    * \"xxxx.csv\" (xxxx a year between 2001 and 2017)\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook also assumes a MySQL database named \"tennis\" \n",
