# tennis

This repository is devoted to exploring machine learning ideas on professional tennis data.  The machine learning ideas are mostly those covered in Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" course (Coursera).  The goals of this project are threefold:

1.  to cement the course ideas by extending them to a new context
2.  to gain experience implementing machine learning algorithms in Python
3.  to gain experience with the Python-MySQL interface.  

Other graduates of the the Coursera course who are interested in extending its core ideas to the setting of professional tennis are welcome to play with my scripts.  I would welcome feedback about best practices, new approaches, or anything else.
