    "### Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement machine learning algorithms, we need to develop a set of informative features.  Following *Machine learning for predicting professional tennis matches* [Sipko, 2015], for each match we assign one player to be \"Player 0\" and the other to be \"Player 1\", and call the outcome a 0 if Player 0 won and a 1 otherwise.  For each match, we produce a set of features, each a measure of *difference* between some characteristic of the two players.  The characteristics we consider include the following (many  of these are from Sipko):\n",
    "\n",
    "* rank:  rank  \n",
    "* rankpts:  rank points  \n",
    "* height:  height  \n",
    "* hand: handedness binary (0 for right, 1 for left)\n",
    "* fsp:  \"first serve is valid\" (percentage)\n",
    "* wfs:  winning first serve (percentage)  \n",
    "* wss: winning second serve (percentage )\n",
    "* wsp:  winning on *any* serve (percentage)\n",
    "* wrp:  winning on returns (percentage) \n",
    "* tpw:  total points won (percentage)\n",
    "* acpg: average number of aces (per game)  \n",
    "* dfpg:  average number of double faults (per game) \n",
    "* bps: break points saved (percentage)\n",
    "* tmw: total matches won (percentage)\n",
    "* retired: binary (`True` if 1st match back since retirement)\n",
    "* fatigue: fatigue score (based on number of matches in past 3 days)\n",
    "* complete: player completeness score (Sipko)\n",
    "* serveadv: score to measure the relative advantage when serving  \n",
    "* direct:  head to head balance with a particular player  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that rank, rankpts, height, and hand can be read from player data directly with no calculation.  On the other hand, fsp, wfs, wss, wsp, wrp, tpw, acpg, dfpg, bps can be calculated for any given match, but for purposes of predicting a future match, need to be averaged over the historical record.  Finally, tmw, retired, fatigue, complete, serveadv, and direct are  not calculated \"match-by-match\", but rather derived from the historical record. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to derive these features, we'll first need to clean the data a bit.  Specifically, we need to deal with missing or null values, as well as rectify incorrect values.  Examples of issues include:  \n",
    "*  The 'score' column contains inconsistent strings for indicating irregular outcomes\n",
    "*  Many matches don't include statistics such as ace rates, double faults, etc.\n",
